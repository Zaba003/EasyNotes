/// Tracks changes to a single MarkupWKWebView, updating the selectionState and informing the MarkupDelegate of what happened.
///
/// Communication between the MarkupWKWebView and MarkupCoordinator is done using a UserContentController.
/// The MarkupCoordinator functions as the WKScriptMessageHandler, receiving userContentController(_:didReceive:)
/// messages.
///
/// One of the key functions of the MarkupCoordinator is to handle the initialization of the MarkupWKWebView as it
/// loads its initial html, css, and JavaScript. The 'editor' element of the document is what we interact with in the
/// MarkupWKWebView. The MarkupCoordinator receives the 'ready' message when the html document loads fully, at
/// which point it is ready to be interacted-with.
///
/// The MarkupCoordinator is used both in SwiftUI and non-SwiftUI apps. In SwiftUI, the MarkupWebView creates the
/// MarkupCoordinator itself, since the MarkupWKWebView (a subclass of WKWebView) is a UIKit component and has
/// to be dealt with by a Coordinator of some kind.
///
/// While the SwiftMarkupEditor is designed to handle multiple MarkupWKWebViews with a single MarkupToolbar,
/// a MarkupCoordinator is coordinating between a single UIKit MarkupWKWebView and something that holds onto
/// the state of the app that is using the MarkupEditor. The SelectionState and selectedWebView are need to be
/// held in the top-level View for SwiftUI as StateObject or as properties of something that will be present
/// for the proper lifetime in a UIKit app (e.g., the top-level UIViewController).
///
/// As events arrive here in the MarkupCoordinator, it takes various steps to ensure our knowledge in Swift of
/// what is in the MarkupWKWebView is maintained properly. Its other function is to inform the MarkupDelegate
/// of what's gone on, so the MarkupDelegate can do whatever is needed.  So, for example, when a focus event
/// is received by this MarkupCoordinator, it notifies the MarkupDelegate, which might want to take some other
/// action as the focus changes, such as updating the selectedWebView.
